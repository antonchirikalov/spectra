# Artifact Management

## BASE_FOLDER Convention

Every sub-agent receives `BASE_FOLDER` in its prompt — the absolute path to `generated_docs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`.

**All file operations use absolute paths built from BASE_FOLDER:**
```
{BASE_FOLDER}/research/{subtopic_slug}/_links.md
{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/_sections/03_comparison.md
{BASE_FOLDER}/illustrations/_manifest.md
```

**Never use relative paths** in `read_file` or `create_file` calls. Always prepend `BASE_FOLDER`.

## Folder Structure

## File Naming Rules

### Subtopic folders
- Slug format: lowercase, underscores for spaces, ASCII-safe
- Examples: `transformer_architecture`, `security_sandboxing`, `mcp_integrations`
- Created by Orchestrator in Phase 0 decomposition

### Research files
- `_links.md` — always this exact name, one per subtopic folder
- `extract_N.md` — numbered sequentially starting from 1
- `_structure.md` — always this exact name, one per subtopic folder
- Leading underscore (`_`) denotes metadata/index files

### Plan files
- `params.md` — always `research/_plan/params.md`
- `toc.md` — always `research/_plan/toc.md`

### Draft files
- Section files: `NN_slug.md` where NN is zero-padded (01, 02, ..., 30)
- Slug derived from ToC section title: lowercase, underscores, ASCII
- Merged document: always `draft/v1.md` (overwritten on revision, no v2/v3)
- Review: always `draft/_review.md` (overwritten on each Critic pass)

### Illustration files
- `_manifest.md` — index of all generated illustrations
- Image files: named by Illustrator based on section and description

### Log files
- `pipeline.log` — written automatically by pipeline_runner.py (loguru)

## Path Construction Examples

Given `BASE_FOLDER = /Users/user/project/generated_docs_20260307_143000/`:

| Agent | Operation | Absolute path |
|---|---|---|
| Retriever | Write links | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/transformer_arch/_links.md` |
| Extractor | Write extract | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/transformer_arch/extract_1.md` |
| Analyst | Read extracts | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/transformer_arch/extract_*.md` (list_dir then read) |
| Analyst | Write structure | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/transformer_arch/_structure.md` |
| Planner | Read all structures | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/*/` (list_dir each) |
| Planner | Write ToC | `{BASE_FOLDER}/research/_plan/toc.md` |
| Writer | Read sources | paths from toc.md, prepend BASE_FOLDER |
| Writer | Write section | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/_sections/02_architecture.md` |
| Editor | Read all sections | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/_sections/` (list_dir) |
| Editor | Write merged | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/v1.md` |
| Critic | Read merged | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/v1.md` |
| Critic | Write review | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/_review.md` |
| Illustrator | Read merged | `{BASE_FOLDER}/draft/v1.md` |
| Illustrator | Write images | `{BASE_FOLDER}/illustrations/` |

## Overwrite Policy

| File | On revision |
|---|---|
| `_links.md` | Never overwritten (Phase 1 runs once) |
| `extract_N.md` | Never overwritten |
| `_structure.md` | Never overwritten (Phase 3 runs once) |
| `toc.md` | Never overwritten (Phase 4 runs once) |
| `NN_slug.md` sections | Overwritten by Writer on revision |
| `v1.md` | Overwritten by Editor on revision |
| `_review.md` | Overwritten by Critic on each pass |
| `_manifest.md` | Created once in Phase 8 |
